# Complete Guide to Deploying the React Native Expo Project

This guide contains all the necessary steps to install, configure, and launch the project from the source code, including terminal commands.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have installed:

- Node.js (recommended version >= 16.x)  
  Check with:  
  ```bash
  node -v
  ```

- npm (or yarn)  
  Check with:  
  ```bash
  npm -v
  ```

- Expo CLI (command-line tool)  
  If not installed, install it globally:  
  ```bash
  npm install -g expo-cli
  ```

- Android Studio (for Android emulator) or Xcode (for iOS simulator, Mac only) â€” optional.

- Expo Go app installed on your mobile device (Android/iOS).

## Installation and Launch Steps

1. **Clone or retrieve the source code**  
   Open a terminal and run:  
   ```bash
   git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
   cd <FOLDER_NAME>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   In the project folder, run:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```  
   *Or if you're using yarn:*  
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the Expo development server**  
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```  
   *Or with yarn:*  
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

   This command starts the Metro Bundler and opens a web page with a QR code.

  1. Launch an emulator via Android Studio.  
  2. In the terminal, run:  
     ```bash

     or  
     ```bash

     ```

- **On an iOS simulator** (Mac only):  
  1. Launch a simulator via Xcode.
